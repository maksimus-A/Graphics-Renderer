# Graphics Renderer

A project to understand some basics about how to render graphics using openGL.

I used GLFW for window creation, and GLAD for getting the specific function pointers used with openGL.

I plan to expand this project greatly. Currently, it renders a rectangle to the window. It then 
uses a fragment shader to show some cool art effects done only using glsl.

I used Visual Studio to create and build the project. Currently unsure how to allow others to build and run this project; I believe
using CMake is the simplest solution that I will look into soon.
